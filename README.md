# DeepMimic4Droid
A DeepMimic Demo run on android, modify from DeepMimic/Core(xbpeng)

Code accompanying the SIGGRAPH 2018 paper:
"DeepMimic: Example-Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning of Physics-Based Character Skills".
The framework uses reinforcement learning to train a simulated humanoid to imitate a variety
of motion skills from mocap data.

This project base on DeepMimic: https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/DeepMimic/index.html
